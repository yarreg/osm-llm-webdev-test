# OSM LLM WebDev Test

A lightweight benchmark to see how well open(-weight) LLMs can generate a working front-end from a single prompt: JavaScript (React), CSS (Tailwind), and HTML.

Gallery of generated sites (results):

## What this project does
- Uses a consistent prompt to ask models to build small React + Tailwind pages/apps.
- Collects the raw model outputs (HTML/CSS/JS) and hosts them for side‑by‑side comparison (gallery).
- Evaluates correctness (builds/boots?), visual fidelity, interactivity, structure, and cleanliness of code.
